# Royer2007-Climate-Sensitivity
# This folder contains a fortran file "gcsldata_export_YCEdited.f" and a text file "proxydata.txt"
# The GEOCARB model and chi-squared statistical model are all in "gcsldata_export_YCEdited.f"
# The model calls the data in "proxydata.txt"
# The model output is "out1.dat" and "out2.dat"
# "out1.dat" contains the results of percentiles
# "out2.dat" contains the results of probability called q01, q10, q33, q50, q66, q90, q99
# to reproduce the pdf (probability density function) in Fig. 2b of Royer et al., 2007, use q01, q10, and q33 
# and normalize to unit-integral over 0>= Climate sensitivity >= 10.4 degree C.
