## getData_PR2011.R
##
## Read CO2 proxy data, including skew-normal/normal fits for CO2 uncertainty
## distributions (previously fit using processData_[something].R).
##
## Assumes that `filename.data` will have been set in the calling routine, and
## customized to read the Park and Royer 2011 data set.
